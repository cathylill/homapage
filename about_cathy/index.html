    <h1>About Cathy</h1>
    <p>
      I am a <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/mission/">web standards</a>
      developer from Newcastle, Australia, who has been building websites for fun 
      and (varying degrees of) profit since about 1999. I have spent most of my 
      career based in Sydney building media websites, with a 
      brief sojourn in the world of enterprise software, and some fun side projects 
      along the way. At the moment I am working at Yahoo!7 as a contracter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to hang out with other geeks at events like <a href="http://sydjs.com">SydJS</a>,
      <a href="http://www.girlgeeksydney.com">Girl Geek Dinners</a>,
      <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5024719962">Bits n Pixels</a>,
      hack days and conferences. I'm also really passionate about developing
      new talent in our industry and recently taught a <a href="/js101/">Javascript and jQuery</a>
      course for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/girldevelopit-sydney/">Girl Develop It</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When not working for 'the man' - or 
      '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Bartz">the woman</a>' as is curently the case -
      I can be found plotting world domination in coffee shops, learning to surf, alternately
      riding and tinkering with my bike and purchasing storage solutions.
