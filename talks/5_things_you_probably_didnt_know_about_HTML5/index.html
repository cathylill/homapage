    <h1>5 Things You (probably) didn't know about HTML5</h1>
    <p>
      This is a talk I gave at the Girl Geek Dinners event on 10th March 2011. The talk 
      covered some of the core aspects of the HTML5 spec, concentrating on what I think
      are the real 'game changing' aspects that reflect the changing nature of web development.
